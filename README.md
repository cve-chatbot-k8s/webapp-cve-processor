# webapp


# This is a go application which downloads cve records and stores them in a postgres database.



```
docker run -e DB_DATABASE=your_database -e DB_PASSWORD=your_password -e DB_USERNAME=your_username -e DB_PORT=your_port -e DB_HOST=your_host your_image

# Flyway is used to manage the database schema. The schema is stored in the resources/db/migration folder. The schema is versioned and flyway will apply the schema to the database when the application starts.

```
Create a flyway.conf file in the resources folder with the following content:
flyway.url=jdbc:postgresql://dbhost:port/dbname
flyway.user=username
flyway.password=password
flyway.locations=filesystem:./migration
```


```
The application uses concurrency to download the cve records.
 The size of buffered channel currently is set to 100.
 The goroutines will download the cve records and store them in the postgres db
